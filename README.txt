LASY: Assistant for Latin Poetry Scansion

This program assumes any entry to be an actual line of Latin poetry. Please note that utilising this program in order to check anything else, e.g. validity of self-created poem, may be inaccurate.

Please use this program as a secondary source of help, primary source being your teachers and peers. This program does not cover the entirety of the complexity of Latin literature, and may not be accurate in scanning.

HOW TO ADD NEW WORDS TO THE DICTIONARY
1. Open "dictionary.txt" in the Text folder.
2. On a new blank line, write using this format: [word]@[alternative forms]@[definitions]@[part of speech, conjugation/declension etc.]
For example, mensa@mensae@table; meal; course(at a meal)@noun f 1
3. The new word will be added to the dictionary when reopening the dictionary window.

n.b. the program automatically sorts the words in alphabetical order.

HOW TO ADD NEW QUIZ
1. Open "quiz.txt" in the Text folder.
2. On a new blank line, write using this format: [line]@[meters] → d for dactyl and s for spondee
For example, Hespere, quis caelo fertur crudelior ignis?@dsss
3. The new quiz will be added when reopening the quiz window.

In case of an error caused by editting "dictionary.txt" and "quiz.txt", "dictionary_backup.txt" and "quiz_backup.txt" will respectively contain the latest version of the documents before the error.

Special thanks to Mrs Nesbit, Ms Baird, Ms Coll.
